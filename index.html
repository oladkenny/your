            <p><b>Oladipupo Kehinde</b> is a passionate individual
                hailing from Ile Ife, Osun State. A Part 2 student of
                Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), he has a deep
                appreciation for the simple joys of life. He
                enjoys riding his bike through the serene
                streets, watching the sun set on the horizon,
                and occasionally losing himself in the world
                of fictional prose. His love for nature often
                draws him to the countryside, where he finds
                peace and inspiration. Above all, Oladipupo
                cherishes the moments spent with his
                siblings, whom he holds dear to his heart.</p>
